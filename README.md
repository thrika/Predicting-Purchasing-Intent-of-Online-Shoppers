â€”E-commerce has developed a lot in the past decades. The increase in use e-commerce websites has led to the need for analysis on the shopper behavior and intention. The model aims to classify whether a visitor/ user is going to make a purchase by analyzing factors like webpages visited and time and date visited. The classification is done in real time and hence it is necessary to find techniques which are fast and have a low complexity. The methods we use to classify are Support Vector Machine (SVM), random forest and neural networks to measure the complexity and time taken for the classification.
